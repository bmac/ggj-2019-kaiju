# Kaiju Home Wrecker

A WebAssembly game built with Rust and [quicksilver](https://www.ryanisaacg.com/quicksilver/).

Build for [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) January 25 - 27, 2019. (Theme: Home)

## Story
You are a kaiju who has no home because they don't make doors in your
size (RUDE!!!). One day, in a fit of jealousy, you head out to the
city to destory those other (adequately door sized) homes to show them
how it feels.
